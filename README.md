# Conway's Game of Life

# Description:
**The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life))**

# Rules
1. A **live** cell with **fewer than two** live neighbors **dies**.
2. A **live** cell with **more than three** live neighbour dies.
3. A **live** cell with **two or three** live neighbors **lives**.
4. A **dead** cell with **three** live neighbours **becomes alive again**.
